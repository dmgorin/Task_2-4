# Task_2-4
 
This godot project is a part of test task for "Atom" company.

It is a project with simple user interface. It has 4 buttons with different functions:

- "Кнопка 1" change scene to another 3D scene;
- "Кнопка 2" display animation;
- "Кнопка 3" shuffle buttons;
- "Кнопка 4" exit programm.

I have developed 2 different window dialog for it: "YesNo" dialog and more flexible custom dialog with list with buttons list setup.
